I finished school at Year 12 and had no prospects of going into University for further studies.  I started my Diploma in Hospitality and Toursim at TAFE which I really enjoyed.  

I have worked for over 20 years in Hotel Management around the Perth Metropolitan area.   During this time I have held various management positions including Rooms Divison Manager, State Revenue Manager and as a General Manager in my later years.  Throughout this time especially in my role as a Rooms Division Manager I was heavily involved in multiple PMS and  POS projects throughout the many hotels I ran.  

From here I moved into Aged care where I have been for the last 8 years.  I started a business with my mum called Compatible Care Nursing Services which is now one of the most prominent agencies in Aged Care in Western Australia. 

I don't like to be idle.  I am usually flat out running my business and taking my two gorgeous kids to their many sporting and dancing commitments. 

One of my greatest passion is the arts and last year I decided to return to my roots and start dancing and Musical Theatre again.  I do this with my daughter and son, different classes of course and have the best fun being involved in the dance concerts with my two kids. 

### Interest in IT

Throughout my time in hotels as a Rooms Division Manager I was heavily involved in multiple PMS and  POS projects at the hotels I ran.   Projects included the initial research of a product, meeting with the sales teams to see what product best suited to our needs, reporting back to owners to receive the capital and go ahead and then onto the configuration and installation.  I also became an expert in all hotel software packages often being called on from other hotels to assist when their teams had issues.  

I took El Questro Wilderness Park (Working Cattle station - major hotel destination) from a manual Whitney Reservation System to a fully fledged PMS system that communicated with its bookings office which is located over 100kms away in Kununurra.  This was a major installation with many limitations and complications as you could imagine being in a remote location but what we achieved was remarkable. 

Part of my role was maintaining and managing the server systems alongside our IT who were offsite and I handled most of the after hours calls regarding IT issues quite successfully.  My knowledge was from an interest and on the job training.  I could not handle letting someone else fix things without teaching me or helping me to understand how these worked.  Back then the Servers ran through CISCO and a lot of the commands were DOS prompted so for an untrained computer IT personal I handled many tasks well and knew that this was something clearly that resonated with me.  

My interest in IT had been sparked.  I knew I had the ability to not only understand software pacakages but also speak the talk with IT people and Owners/Directors. 

The last ten years has seen me move to Aged Care.  In this time I have found that many of the products just don't work as well as they could.  Aged Care is trying to become more heavily customer service driven and the software products are very good clinically but not so much for services provided (Non Clinical).  They have focused on the need to communicate with Government departments for funding and to cover the clinical aspects of the health profession.  Unfortunately this has left little improvement in the way of Customer Service. 

I have created my own software that I use in my business with a colleague of mine from hotels.  I am the brains of the content and he has been the developer of the Software and sites.  I want to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve with my booking engine and perhaps one day roll it out and onsell it to others in the Aged Care Sector.  

I decided it was time to formally check in and do some studies in the field I find myself often coming back to and getting involved in.  IT!  I did some research and decided to opt for Open Universities as it worked around my busy work schedule and my family.  This has brought me here to RMIT.

I am hoping to learn in a more formal and in depth context how to build and manage website and how to do some great back end work to make them do so much more than just a basic website.  

## IT Job I would like to do


[Job Advertisement](https://www.seek.com.au/job/50052480?type=standout#searchRequestToken=71bfe6f2-d872-47ee-bd82-578a853718af)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66361136/84560671-b7d39900-ad78-11ea-8a9e-29d98b2a1275.png)

This role would be enhancing and further developing the companies systems and applications.  If successful I would be working on development of the program, developing the Front End to look and work better for the user and implementing this out to customers and problem solving any issues the user finds with the system upgrades.   I would need to be all across the product both with the technical aspect of coding, testing and support as well as staying ahead of the game in research and knowledge base of the industry and the product I am working on. This appeals to me as I have been the user wanting functionality from applications/Software/Package/Programmes and to be a part of making this happen for users would be the ultimate. 

The skills required to do this job would be an understanding of web development platforms such as .NET the ability to work with Database structures such as SQL and to know the web languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I would also need to understand and be able to work with programming languages such as Visual Basic (VB.NET) and C#.  I would also have to have an understanding of the sector this particular application is required for to be able to better understand the needs of the consumer. 

I don't have any of the experience or skills required right now to do this project but I hope to at the end of this course. I am hoping to finish my Bachelor of Information technology but I will be focusing on the programming subjects earlier.  I will work hard in all my group sessions and learn from those that have done some programming and practice and develop as much as I can. 

## Personal Profile

I have attached three different online tests to give you a better idea about who I am and how I work :wink:

1. [Myer Briggs Personality Test.pdf](https://github.com/hpnowlan/AboutMe/files/4774210/Myer.Briggs.Personality.Test.pdf)

2. [Learning Style Study](https://www.how-to-study.com/study-skills-articles/print-article.asp?aid=148)

3. [Leadership Skills Test](https://psychologytoday.tests.psychtests.com/results.htm?trans_num=28216900M5950144H)

**What do these tests mean?** 

I am a great problem solver.  Very resourceful and easily adapt when necessary.  I am a critical and logical thinker when making decisions and rarely let my emotions cloud my judgement. I use information at hand to make the best decisions possible and trust my own judgement. 

I am curious and want to learn as much as I can about how things work.  I best handle details and decisions now rather than in the future.  I am practical and enjoy working with people around me who are stronger in the long term visionary work.  

I stated above that I would like to be in a role in computer programming and this came up in my list of well suited jobs in my personality test.  I am intolerant to inefficient processes which is another reason I love IT as I can make a programme reduce the inefficiencies many people bring to tasks. 

I am the "Problem Solver"  I help to optimize others daily lives.  Sounds like I am a Computer Programme! I have the ability to analyze, build and improve things.

I am a visual learner so group challenges will be great for me as we will be working from afar and sharing ideas and information.  I see better than I hear so to have a discussion on a saved chat or somewhere I can reference back means I will continue working or thinking about the group work after we have all been together. 

I scored well in the leadership test which I think will be a strong asset to my group as if we go off track I can assist in mediating and bringing things back in line.  I will be able to contribute and help others that don't feel heard or feel overrun by stronger personalities in the group.  This will be an asset for any group I work in. When forming a team I would be looking for people that like to enjoy working together even if in the background and not as vocal as others and want to contribute.  You get a good look at this in the discussion boards and in the online sessions as some of the other students interact and listen and also share their Points of View.  These are the students I will try to form a group with.  

## Project Idea

### Overview
My project idea is to develop an umbrella that is Bluetooth/GPS paired with your phone or smart watch and it alerts you as to whether you need to take it with you due to pending rainfall.  It would communicate with a weather app and send you the probability of rain as you walk out the door.  This would prompt you to take the umbrella or leave it at home.  I would create it to link one umbrella to a family or to a single person depending on the circumstances. 

### Motivation
How often do you leave for work, or an important business meeting and get caught out without your umbrella?  I do regularly so this would be very helpful for me and I am sure others to remind them to pack this on days with predicted rainfall.    It would be able to determine rain from the attached weather apps it is paired with and can determine when you are leaving by a GPS loop at your door.  
The BOM weather shows just in my area alone there was 87 days of rainfall in 2019 and not a single month of the year had no rainfall. 

### Description of my project
This umbrella would have to be built with Bluetooth capabilities so that it can communicate with google weather and or other sites and also with the owners smart phone or watch.  I would develop this to be able to be paired with multiple users to the one umbrella as often you are travelling as a family and only take the one umbrella.  The other option would be to make them single size umbrella for more convenience of space and have them only be able to communicate one on one.  I would manufacture and make large for multi-use and small for single use umbrellas.

There would be an app created that would be loaded onto your phone/ipad and then pair the umbrella to this app.  I would call it the 'Smart Umbrella'.  The app would do the communicating with google weather to determine what the prediction is for rainfall and communicate this back to your umbrella.  The app would then also track your location and notify you if it is alerted that you are leaving your home base and rain is predicted.  You will then receive a notification on your phone or watch that you must remember to take the umbrellla as rain is predicted today.

I would put some rules into the app that it only alerts you so many times if you have not taken the umbrella.  This means that if you make a conscious decision not to take the umbrella it would stop reminding you as this could be quite annoying to be getting continuous alerts.  I think that it would also be useful to add in an override button that you accept the alert and that you will not be taking the umbrella. The umbrella itself would have a sensor so it can determine if it is in proximity to you when you leave.  

Communication criteria would be built into the app to improve the battery life.  In the winter months you might have it refresh in the background 1/2 hourly to hourly to ensure the most updated information but during summer months perhaps it checks in daily. 

The design would be that of a normal umbrella and the sensors would be built into the stem of the umbrella.  This could then be charged into a wall power socket for charging overnight to ensure that it remains on and connected during the day.  It would be very non-invasive and you would not even know that this umbrella was any different to a normal umbrella aesthetically. 

The app itself would be easily accessed through the apple and google play stores and a web based product for Mac and Windows users. 

Once paired this umbrella and its app would do all the work and the user would only have to remember to bring their umbrella along when advised rain was coming.  How handy would this be!

### Tools and Technologies
The tools and technology for this project to work would be an IOS and Android App which would do all the communicating to the weather sites, the umbrella and your phone/watch and the umbrella as the hardware.  You would need a charging base and a sync station which would need Bluetooth and GPS capabilities.  You would need software that allows for automatic messaging and some programming for the GPS to work on a radius so it does not advise the user too early or too late.  I am not 100% sure of the hardware I would need to make this happen and hope to learn more about this in the coming months in order to create my smart umbrella. 

### Skills required
To be honest I am still unsure of this.  It would require the skills to write and create an app in IOS and Android.  I would need to learn Xcode and Swift.  I would need Bluetooth hardware for the umbrella and I would need to learn some graphic design.  There is templates you can get to help with this such as NOW, TETHR and DO,  iOS iPhone, Stark UI kit, Stitch, Phoenix and Apply PIxels to name a few. 

I think with the skills I develop in my Bachelor of Information Technology and the collaborations I make this is definitely a feasible project and one that could be created with very little difficulty as it would be talking to existing apps for the data.

If this project is successful I believe the outcome would be a positive one.  People will be happy that they didn't get rained on and the convenience and cost would hopefully be quite low.   Although getting rained on is not life or death it can interfere with an important meeting if you are drenched before arriving and can also affect your health.  You will be less likely to catch a cold if you are not sitting for hours in wet clothing
